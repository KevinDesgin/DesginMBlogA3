During the time for exporting the prototybe of the game. I had ran into a few issue.

<p> During the playtesting, I had handed form for playtesters to fill in and here are the few responses on the game. (NOTE: The game was far from finished with a floor and some music yet implemented) </p>

<p>In general, majority of players were able to play the game and pinpoint what the idea of my gameplay was going to be. There may have being a mix of different feelings but overall was close to my intentions.</p>

However there were some small issues during their playtesting. The first one was that the very first starting room was TOO bright. This was caused when I was cautious about mucking around with the bloom effect it had on ALL light sources. So I turn the emission of the wall in the first room to stop it from blinding the players and having no effects on all other rooms with light. THe second was that there was a lack of music spread within each room. To tackle this, I copy the sound object and spread it around the room. This gives out even spread of music. I did this over the alternative of increasing the size of the proxy as that would clash sound within another room. The last of the problems was that there were spots on the stairs that was unwalkable. SO I had to readjust it all from the beginning. Which caused further problems within other rooms. But now ALL stairs should be walkable.
