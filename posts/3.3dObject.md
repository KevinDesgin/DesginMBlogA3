In my previous blog, I said that I wanted to create a path using a bunch of spiraling staircase. However when searching for one in Sketchfab, there were none that would fit my scenes. So I decided to blender my own stiarcase with the help of the following video.

<p>Once the staircase was done, I tried to import the staircase into unity. HOwever I was faced with another problem with the mesh collidor of the staircase being angled 90 from original staircase.</p>

After searching for hours, I realised that the root problem lies within blender. Where there was still a modification that has yet to be applied properly. Once the modification was applied, the mesh collidor suddenly fixed itself in blender.

<p>Once that problem was solved the came another. Within unity, my character was not able to walk up the stairs. So I tried adding in a code to my character to enable it to walk up the stair. However, something unexpected came when I was able to walk up the stair with AND without the code. The solution was to adjust the player size to be skinnier sp that the base of the model can interact with the mesh collidor.</p>

<p>From there on, I continue to import different assets from sketchfab as well as some drawing asset that I created a while back. I also used blender to quickly model a city building that would later be imported into my third layer of my gameplay.</p>

<p>While continuing to work on my game space, I notice something wrong when using terrains. While play testing, players are able to see through underneath the terrain to see other assets floating in the sky. I quickly fixed this with the help of blend and unity 3d object to patch the see throught of my terrain.</p>
