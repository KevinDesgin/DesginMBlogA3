During the implementaiton of adding audio to my unity game. I decided to choose the following four songs from the youtube audio library.

<p> 1. My dog is happy - Reed Mathis</p>
This song will be placed in the second floor of my gameplay as it has this happy and kid like sound to it. THis was meant to represent the beginning of when I first got involved with the music world. 

<p> 2. Two hearts - Track Tribe</p>
This song will be placed in the third floor. This song is meant to represent in time of when I started performing music to a small group of audience. Commenly at that time, I was performing alot of pop music. Which is why I decided that the third floor had to genre from pop.

<p> 3. Train of thoughts - Hanu Dixit</p>
This song will be placed in the fourth floor. With the background being filled with neon lighting. I knew that an electronic sound would fit this room. This room was meant to represent the time when I first discovered the genre of electric music and that I had a period of listing to mosly electric music. 

<p> 4. Helium - TrackTribe</p>
This song will be placed in the fifth/top floor. With that floor referening to my present preferences of music, I decided that a calm song would describe my taste of music. I also wanted to accompany the fifth floor being a night city sky background with a song that is light and calm.
